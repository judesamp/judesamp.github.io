#The Iron Yard: Day Six
<p class="first">
  It's the morning of day 7 here at the <a href="http://theironyard.com/">Iron Yard Academy</a> in Atlanta. The sun is coming up. There's a chill in the air. I'm listening to <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/03/23/291167043/first-listen-mac-demarco-salad-days">Mac Demarco's album 'Salad Days"</a> on my headphones.</p>

  I'm glad to be here, getting ready for another day. It's funny, for the last few years, I got in the habit of staying up late and getting up late. I'd drag myself out of bed and into work. When I think about those years now, I realize how little excitement I felt about my work. It's probably no accident that I chose the word "drag" to describe what I did on those mornings.

  So yeah, The Iron Yard isn't easy. The days are long and sometimes overwhelming. But they're full. They're challenging. And for me, that old familiar "drag" is absent. Of course, maybe there's a little Don Draper to the situation—you know, loving the beginning of things. And I can't deny that I do love the beginning of things. But I've been building from the ground up with coding for almost two years—and I'm still fired up about it. At this point, I suspect it's not the romance that's fueling the fire (though that might be part of it too); I think it's the solving of problems. I just flat like to make things work.

  Anyway, enough of my—what do you even call this—Philosophizing? Navel-gazing? Yeah, probably the latter. But let's get to specifics. Over the last three or four days at The Iron Yard Academy, we've continued our whirlwind tour of Ruby. We've looked at methods, classes, class methods, and inheritance. Today, we start looking at <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a>, a testing tool for Ruby code. So I might feel different about the "drag" thing by the end of the day:)
