So, I'm afraid. I wish I wasn't, but there it is. I'm at the precipice now, the jumping off point. <a href="http://theironyard.com/academy/rails-engineering/">Rails bootcamp</a> starts in under two weeks. Several times lately, I've been reminded: the mind can be a trap. I keep thinking about all of the decisions that led me here; I can't change them, but part of me desperately wishes I could—just a few of them, really. What if I'd made this decision five years ago, ten years ago? My life would be set, right? What if I'd been smarter, stronger, and better all along? And yeah, that's the fear (and doubt) talking. Because I'm actually pumped about the road ahead. I want to go to dev bootcamp. I want to learn Rails (and more!). I want to spend more time coding.

So what's going on here? What am I afraid of? And yes, I'm going to do my best to be <a href="/choosing-the-iron-yard">very specific</a>.
<ul>
<li>For the first time in a long time, I'm afraid of tomorrow. It's uncertain. It's unmapped. I've been doing the same thing for more than ten years. I'm a creature of habits. Change is scary.</li>
<li>I'm afraid of the upset this could cause my family. I'm a new dad. My amazing daughter is eight months old. My wife is awesome—and so supportive. And I know the road I've chosen is going to mean new difficulties for them. Yes, I hope to build a better future for all of us, but I worry about the challenges my family will face in the present.</li>
<li>I'm afraid of the test. Am I good enough? Smart enough? Can I face the things I'm not good at—public speaking, taking criticism, whatever parts of coding I happen to be particularly horrible at, etcetera? There are moments when I know that "yes" is the answer to all of these questions, when I know I can face the test ahead, but the self-doubt is never far away.</li>
<li>I'm afraid of being broke. That's all I'll say about that:)</li>
</ul>

Obviously, this is an incomplete list, but I think I've hit the highlights of my own personal mind trap. The key, I guess, is not getting stuck in that trap—and getting out when you are stuck. Because I suspect that the fears themselves aren't the problem; the problem is going round and round in the accompanying anxiety. 

So that's where I'm at. Trying not to get stuck. Trying not to fixate. And though I don't have any miracle fixes figured out, I've been running across a nice formulation on twitter:

<code>fun == hard returns true</code>

More and more, I think this is one of the secrets of life that I've yet to learn. Hard (and scary) ain't the end of the world.
