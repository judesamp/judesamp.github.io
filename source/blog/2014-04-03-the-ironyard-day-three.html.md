Okay, this might shortchange the day a little, but...Ruby methods and refactoring. That was day three. There was a lot of programming head.

One thing I relearned: It's good to know what kind of object you're dealing with. Is it a string, a symbol, an integer, an array, a hash? It matters. Really matters.

More later.
