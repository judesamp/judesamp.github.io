I. Jumping is the hardest part

Well, I did it. I quit my editing job of more than a dozen years to attend the Iron Yard Academy in Atlanta. I'm still a few weeks from the first day (March 31), but the endings have already started. Yesterday, I spent an hour on the phone with a possible replacement; I suspect she'll be great at my job.

Don't worry about that noise, that's just me hyperventilating. I'm sure I'll be fine eventually.

###II. Jumping is the easiest part 
As a teenager, I played a lot of basketball. I sprained a lot of ankles. I soon figured out: It's not the jumping that'll get you; it's the landing. But while you're in the air, you might as well enjoy the ride. 99% of the time, you land just fine. Of course, I still have nightmares about the other landings, the bad ones that left my ankle screaming in pain. But here's the thing: I loved basketball more than I dreaded the pain. 

###III. They call it jumping for a reason
I've been scoping out dev bootcamps for a couple of years. What I learned: It's easy to get stuck in the moment before the leap. There's an illusory thrill to that in between time. And there's no cost. But it's not real life until you bounce.

I'm sure I'll catch my breath at some point. Or not.
