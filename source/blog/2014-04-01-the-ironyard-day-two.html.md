I'm starting to figure out that I'm not going to have a lot of time to write during my twelve weeks at The Iron Yard, but I'm going to try and write at least a few times a week. Day two looked like this: 


<ul>
  <li>We started the morning going over the previous day's homework. Someone would bring their computer to the front and our instructor would hook it up to the huge TV monitor. Another student would then talk through the code, explaining what they thought was going on. We went through three or four programs in an hour and a half. The lesson: Not only do we need to know how to code; we need to understand how to talk about it.</li>
  <li>After the early morning session, we spent some time going over hashes in Ruby. Things got nested quickly:)</li>
  <li>In the afternoon lab, we started working on our next assignment: a personality quiz. The guidelines looked like this:</li>
  <br />
      <ul>
        <li>at lease 10 questions</li>
        <li>use hashes to store data</li>
        <li>scoring must involve at least one ternary operator</li>
        <li>report results of personality quiz to user</li>
        <li>Bonus: multiple users complete and store data (within life of program)</li>
        <li>show user results (paragraph, table, percentages)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you're interested, you can see my personality quiz <a href="https://gist.github.com/judesamp/9917942">here</a>.</p>
  
</ul>

<p>
  More later.
