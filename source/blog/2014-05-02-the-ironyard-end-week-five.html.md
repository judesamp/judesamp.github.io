First, it's been a while. Feels like I'm coming up for air after a long dive. But there's not long to refuel. Tonight is the beginning of <a href="http://atlanta.startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend</a> in Atlanta, a 54-hour hackathon (my first hackathon of any kind, by the way). So I'll gasp while I can, I guess.

<p>
As for The Iron Yard, the last two weeks have been intense. A lot of coding, a lot of Rails, a lot of challenges—in and out of the flow of the course.
</p>

<p>
But the time and effort is starting to pay off. I can type out a Rails controller off the top of my head—-and that's weird, right? Honestly, I thought we'd be scaffolding/generating all the basics, but we've mostly been typing them out by hand. Our instructor, <a href="shelbyswitzer.com">Shelby Switzer</a>, is really pushing us on the fundamentals, pushing us to know how something really works before we take the shortcuts. And Rails has a lot of shortcuts.

<p>
Yesterday, Shelby guided us through the process of building authentication (login, logout baby!) into a site or application. The process was substantial...I was thinking that this was going to take a while to get straight. And then at the end, Shelby introduced the Rails 'has_secure_password' method. Suddenly, we were stripping away the methods we'd just built to handle authentication. All of these, Shelby, explained, Rails gives you for free.
</p>

<p>
So there's the lesson of the moment: Rails gives you a lot for free, BUT it might be a good idea to make some payments up front anyway.
