<p class="first">So. About my first post. After a reread, I realized I'd fallen into some old habits. As a writer, I distance myself. I get vague. I avoid specifics and details. I guess at its core, this is a form of hiding. And it reveals the great paradox of writing for me. I want to be known; it's why I write. There's part of me that wants to connect. But another part of me is terrified of being exposed in this way—even if I'm the one initiating the exposure. But these days, I'm all about doing things differently. That means that it's time for specifics.</p>

###Why the Iron Yard?
I'd like to say I chose The Iron Yard after extensive research and forethought. And I suppose that, in one sense, I did. I've made a hobby of reading about dev bootcamps—from Dev BootCamp in San Francisco to Bitmaker Labs in Toronto to CodeFellows in Seattle to the Nashville Software School. I mean, I was a licensed lurker. So I guess you could say I knew the lay of the land. But when it came to actually choosing The Iron Yard, I made the decision to apply about two minutes after I found The Iron Yard's website. There were basically two crucial factors in making that choice. First, The Iron Yard was opening a coding academy in Atlanta. I could attend without having to pay for a place to stay. That meant I could almost afford to do it:) Second, The Iron Yard offers a guarantee: a job within six months or your money back. It's nice to have a partner in the boat with you, partcularly if you're setting out for parts unknown.

And yeah, I read more about The Iron Yard before actually applying, enough to put myself at ease with the idea of taking this leap. But the truth is that I was ready to jump—and the Iron Yard seemed like a soft landing spot:) 

I'm going to delve deeper in my next post, including taking a look at what scares me about the road ahead. So, more specifics.
