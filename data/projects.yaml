                 An app that connects wine enthusiasts, making it easy for them to buy and sell wine from one another. 

                 I helped build this app as part of the team at 10 Rocket. It helps buyers find nearby sellers using the Geocoder gem, processes and manages subscriptions using Stripe, and stores images on S3 with a little assist from the Carrierwave and Fog gems. 

                 * This code lives in a private repository. Code samples available upon request.

                 An app for viewing famous love letters, mashing them up, and sending them out into the world. I built it over two weeks. 

                 This app includes the ability to sign up using the Omniauth strategies for both Twitter and Facebook. It hooks into the Lob API to facilitate the sending of love letters via snail mail and uses the Prawn gem to create a pdf for printing purposes. Also employs Stripe to process payments.

                 A running log I built for my own use. It helps runners track their runs and progress over time. I'm hoping to include more features soon, including adding goals and multiple ways to chart statistics. 

                 This app makes use of several javascript workflows (for practice purposes), including both unobtrusive javascript and more API-like JSON responses filtered through the RABL gem.
